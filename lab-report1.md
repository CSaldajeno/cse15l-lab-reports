* The working directory is /home
* Running cd with no arguments takes you to the home directory
* cd changes your working directory to the directory you apply as the argument, but since there is no argument or error, cd directs to the default home directory and returns a new prompt.
* The output is not an error.

![Image2](cd_argument.png)
* The working directory is /home/lecture1
* The working directory is changed to the subcategory of the home directory, lecture1.
* The output is not an error.

![Image3](cd_path.png)
* The working directory is /home/lecture1
* cd is used to change the working directory, and since the argument is a file instead of a directory, the output results in an error, stating that the argument 'is not a directory.'
* The output is an error, since cd expects a directory, not a file

![Image1](ls.png)
* The working directory is /home/lecture1
* Running ls with no arguments outputs a list of the current directory's contents, in this case the files in lecture1
* The output is not an error
